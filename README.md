# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## The Dataset
The large movie review dataset contains a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. The dataset contains an even number of positive and negative reviews. The authors considered only highly polarized reviews. A negative review has a score ≤ 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score ≥ 7 out of 10. Neutral reviews are not included in the dataset. The dataset is divided into training and test sets. The training set is the same 25,000 labeled reviews.

The sentiment classification task consists of predicting the polarity (positive or negative) of a given text.
